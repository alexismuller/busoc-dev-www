ASIM Facility Responsible Centre

ASIM is an ESA science instrument assembly to be flown on the Columbus External Platform Facility (CEPF) of the ISS (International Space Station). The ASIM concept has been proposed by DNSC (Danish National Space Centre, formerly DSRI (Danish Space Research Institute)), with the objective to observe TLEs (Transient Luminous Events) that occur in the Earth's upper atmosphere accompanied by thunderstorms in the lower atmosphere. These events are known as blue jets, sprites and elves, the phenomena were first observed in 1989.They are electromagnetic energy discharges that occur well above the normal lightning we usually observe from ground. The ISS is the best space platform for thunderstorm observations because the orbit at about 400 km altitude is close to the Earth. It also covers +/- 51.6 degree in latitude and therefore all of the major thunderstorm regions. ASIM is designed to be accommodated on the starboard deck location of the CEPF (Columbus External Payload) platform.

The two scientific instruments onboard ASIM are: 

* the Miniature X-ray and gamma-ray Sensor (MXGS). It aims at the detection of Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGF) by measuring X-rays and Gamma-rays from thunderstorms.
* the Modular Multi-spectral Imaging Array (MMIA).  It aims at the observation of Transient Luminous Events (TLE) that occur in the Earth's upper atmosphere accompanied by thunderstorms in the lower atmosphere.

The ASIM concept has been worked on by Danish, Norwegian and Spanish institutions. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Torsten Neubert from The Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The Danish company TERMA was responsible for the development of ASIM. Terma is the main industrial contractor leading the industrial consortium. The main partners and responsibilities are:  

* DTU Space, Denmark; Scientific leader. Leader of the MXGS consortium. Responsible for the MMIA photomultipliers and the MXGS and MMIA computers.  
* Terma, Denmark; Responsible for the MMIA cameras. 
* University of Valencia, Spain; MXGS mechanical structure and instrument application software. 
* University of Bergen, Norway; the MXGS detectors.
* Space Research Centre, Poland: the MXGS power supply.
* OHB-Italia, Italy; the ASIM payload computer.

The B.USOC is the control and command centre for ASIM. It sends telecommands, receives ASIM telemetries, monitors the instrument healthiness, and transfers the science data to the ASIM Science Data Centre in Denmark.
