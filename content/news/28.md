April 21, 2015: first command sent to B.USOC to the ISS Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL).


In the morning of April 21, the B.USOC team successfully activated the FSL module in COLUMBUS and both sent test commands and received ancillary data leading to the start of a new activity in B.USOC. This successful end to end test prepares future science operations and is currently analysed in details.
