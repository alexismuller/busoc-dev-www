This Observatory onboard the ISS is tracking the Sun now for more than 8 years!

The instrument was designed to work for only 18 months, but it is still running â€“ its operation is exceeding all expectations. Launched at the 2008 minimum of solar cycle 23, it observed the also the maximum of solar cycle 24 in 2015 and now is still active in the decrease phase. Solar energy input to the earthâ€™s atmosphere and its variations are a major factor in the climate models and are accurately monitored only since the beginning of the space age.
