EPO3 Water properties
============================

In the context of collaboration between ESA and UNICEF an overview lecture was given with demonstration of various water properties. The recording of the demonstration was used to produce ESA educational multimedia material for upper primary school teachers and their students aged 10-12.

LESS
=============================

One live link was required to give students an appreciation of the differences between the conditions of weightlessness and gravity through 2 simple, relevant demonstrations related to mass measurement and capillarity.

In this context, the B.USOC was identified as a major operational centre for the conduct of operations of the two educational experiences LESS 2 and 3 which were conducted by Frank De Winne during his stay in the ISS during the OasISS mission. As part of this activity was used at European level to ensure the promotion of the Columbus program, in addition to writing operation procedures, the centre had provided technical support for  installation of Belgian site(s) that were used for promotional events in relation with the mission.
