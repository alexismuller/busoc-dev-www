During PROBA-V mission, the Energetic Particle Telescope (EPT) will measure the high-energy particle fluxes with very good energy, angular and mass resolutions. It measures the energy deposited by charged particles into twelve sensitive elements and processes the information to identify the particles (0.2-10 MeV electrons, 4-300 MeV H and 16-1000 MeV He ions) and to determine their energy spectra and angular distribution.

The EPT consists of two "particle telescopes" placed in series separately adapted to low and high-energy ranges. The low-energy section consists of two silicon detectors. The high-energy section is a so-called "range telescope" in which the thicker silicon detector is used as a sensor and a stack of absorbers and scintillator-based detectors produces a digital measurement of the total energy (E). The EPT overall dimensions are 205 mm x 205 mm x 190 mm . Its weight is about 6 kg, with the electronic readout included. The power consumption is lower than 6 Watts. The maximum energy-dependent geometrical factor of the detector is ~1.5 cm2sr. The radius of the EPT circular aperture was set to a diameter of 35 mm. The resulting maximum field of view angle is 50 Deg.

The B.USOC acquires the raw data of the EPT instrument as also the ancillary data from the ESA control centre at Redu after each scheduled satellite pass. The B.USOC executes the initial processing of the data which is afterwards made available to UCL/CSR. It serves also as a relay for the on-board configuration of the instrument and assures the storages of the processed data by the scientists.

The EPT data centre at the B.USOC has the following responsibilities:

 * act as the interface between the mission operations centre (MOC) at the ESA Redu station and the Centre for Space Radiation (CSR) at UCL 
 * timely acquire the raw data from Redu * Validate and process (level 0) the data 
 * host a backup of CSR processed data (level 1) 
 * host the visualization software used by the CSR 
 * timely transfer the configuration data to Redu 
 * provide operational supervision.
