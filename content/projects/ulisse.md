SUVIM was a Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (IASB-BIRA) network of stations measuring UV solar radiation with several instruments at each station. The network produced several UV radiation group at IASB-BIRA and provided UV indexes and solar irradiances at the stations in quasi-real time.
heThe project intended to distribute all the original data obtained since 1993 in the frame of the ULISSE metadata.
The network consisted currently of six stations with a complement of instruments at each station.
