The experiment container SMD is a class 2 payload  which can be inserted in the FSL Laboratory. SMD allows to study foams, emulsions and granular matters in microgravity.
The container provides optical microscope, single and multi specke diffusing wave spectroscopy, supporting also time resolved correlations, to investigate primarily dynamics on the surface of and inside opaque but translucent materials.

The experiment container can be extended with on-orbit replaceable science cartridges. These so-called sample cell units are smart inserts that can include their own custom agitation mechanism, sensorics, thermalization and thereby expand the science goals of the mission.


Two experiments will be tested in SMD :

Foam-C
================

The FOAM-C (Foam Coarsening) experiment is dedicated to the study of the rheological properties of aqueous foams. Aqueous foams consist of bubble assemblies separated by liquid. On Earth this study is made difficult by the setting of liquids under the action of gravitation. These are concentrated at the bottom of the sample, drying the foam: the bubbles are deformed into polyhedra.
FOAM-C includes the analysis of twenty sample cells for which SMD will measure the growth of bubbles within the foam due to the gas diffusion between the bubbles (the gas diffusing small bubbles towards larger ones until the disappearance of small bubbles).

The team of Professor Nicolas Vandewalle of the University of Li√®ge (GRASP, Group for Research and Applications in Statistical Physics) has been involved for several years in the preparation of the FOAM-C experiment by their contribution in the development of the stirring mechanism during parabolic flights, and during the FOAM-Stability experiment carried aboard the ISS in 2009 by Frank De Winne.



CompGran
================

The CompGran experiment uses a specialized unit to study the diffusion of kinetic energy within the granular material. The ISS is an interesting place for this kind of study due to the fact that in microgravity there is no sedimentation of particles and therefore the long-term behavior can be measured, which is necessary for modelling. On Earth, this study can contribute among others to the improvement of the process monitoring of industrial processes using bulk materials.

CompGran is a German experiment coordinated by professor Matthias Sperl from the German Aerospace center (DLR) and University of Cologne with participation of scientists from Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United States. The Airbus Defence and Space site in Friedrichshafen is responsible for the development of CompGran.
