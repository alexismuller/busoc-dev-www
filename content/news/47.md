Pericles:Promoting  and  Enhancing  Reuse  of  Information throughout  the  Content  Lifecycle  taking  account  of  Evolving  Semantics

B.USOC participated in the FP-7 PERICLES project from February 2013 to its end in April 2017.
PERICLES was coordinated by King’s College London, UK and its partners are University of Borås (Sweden), CERTH- ITI (Greece), DotSoft (Greece), Georg-August-Universität Göttingen (Germany), University of Liverpool (UK), Space Application Services (Belgium), XEROX France and University of Edinburgh (UK). Two additional partners provide the two case studies: Tate Gallery (UK) brought the digital art and media case study and B.USOC (Belgian Users Support and Operations Centre) brought the space science case study.

PERICLES concentrated around the preservation of the SOLAR mission science and operation data on the ISS which lasted from February 2008 to February 2017.  All tests and activities respected strictly the ESA data policy. It used also other data as the data from the UV ground based network of the Belgian Royal Institute for Space Aeronomy and EUMETSAT data on cloud optical thickness. The new concepts developed are precursors of future long term data preservation programmes  needed for long duration studies in earth and space sciences.

Through its “Community of Practice” activities, PERICLES has been effective in demonstrating networked communication not widely common in the science community. The fact that much of the research in PERICLES  originates  from  disciplines  outside  mainstream  disciplines  usually  involved  preservation research, has helped find commonalities in a peer to peer exchange with the science  communities.  For example, computer  linguistics,  logical  mathematics,  quantum  theory  were  all  employed in the investigation of the PERICLES approach, topics that resonated well with the science  community and fostered the creation of the Community of Practice on the Reuse of Science data and on Semantic Shift.
