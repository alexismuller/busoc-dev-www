During the Increment 9 of the ISS utilization, two experiments with Belgian participation were hold in the Russian module: Neurocog (ULB, CNRS and CNES) and Cardiocog (KULeuven University and CNES). For both expeditions 9 crew members were taking part to these experiments, among them Russian cosmonaut Gennady I. Padalka and the American astronaut Edward M. Fincke.

Presentation
======================

These experiments already flew during the previous Odissea and Cervantes short-duration missions; and this time, the scientists benefited from the opportunity to study the evolution of the activities and the brain and of the heart in microgravity on a long-term period.
Numerous sessions were foreseen and were distributed all along the increment duration: at the beginning (May 2004), in the middle (July 2004) and at the end (October 2004).
During each session, the various PIs and scientists followed the experiments running in real-time from the B-USOC telescience and operations room (procedures and experimental timelines checks and corrections if needed).
Scientists were therefore able to interact at anytime with the other operational centres and coordinators involved (in ESTEC, in Russia) if required. 


Responsibilities
=======================

Support to the scientists during the inflight operations.

Cardiocog
================

On May 8,July 5, September 18 and October 18 2004, the crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) was running the Belgian experience Cardiocog. The objectives were to assess changes in cardiovascular function induced by long stays in an microgravity environment, to compare these changes with the data before and after the flight and to compare the effects of microgravity during continuous short periods or during simulations.
On the ground, the B-USOC (Belgian User Support and Operations Centre) kept track of the experience and welcomed the leading researchers in close collaboration with ESA.

Neurocog
=================

On May 4, May 5, May 6, July 6, July 8, September 20, September 22, October 17 and October 19 2004, the crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) was running the Belgian experience Neurocog. With the Neurocog experience, scientists wanted to study the effects caused by the conditions of spaceflight on the perception and memorization process spatiotemporal markers of astronauts when they conduct research in a virtual environment."
