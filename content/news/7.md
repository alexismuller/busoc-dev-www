The ISS astronauts stopped an ammonia leak in the ISS external cooling loop by replacing a suspected pump unit by the spare one and checking all connections on Saturday May 11.

This leak had appeared on May 9 and posed a threat to the ISS power conditioning as the main function of this cooling loop is to control the temperature of the electrical motors moving the solar panels. The coolant lines will have to be monitored for several weeks before it is certain that the leak has been fully fixed by the replacement and maintenance EVA of May 11.

The B.USOC daily operation report of the solar package (SOLAR) operations of May 12 demonstrates a return to normal operations of the ISS.
