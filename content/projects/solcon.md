From January 16th 2003 to February 1st 2003, B-USOC hosted the Belgian Remote SOLCON Payload Operation and Control Centre (POCC), which was the only European PI Centre involved and being directly connected to NASA HitchHiker operation networks (via the ESA IGS network, managed by ESOC IGS control team).

The SOLCON experiment (developed by a team at the Royal Meteorological Institute of Brussels, and that was aimed at studying the Solar Constant) had flew on many previous Shuttle missions, and was this time implemented in the project Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science, Technology and Research (FREESTAR).

Responsibilities
===================


The mission roles and responsibilities were shared between all international partners:

* The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) at JSC: overall mission management
* The Hitchhiker Project at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC): management of FREESTAR payloads operations
* The GSFC Attached Shuttle Payload Center (ASPC): POCC for the FREESTAR mission. The Operations Director (OD) was the principal interface authority for overall ASPC operations, to coordinate experiment status, replanning, and anomaly resolution. He worked closely with the SOLCON PIs in order to ensure the maximum data acquisition, commanding capabilities, anomalies troubleshooting
* The Belgian POCC: PI centre, which determined the experiment objectives, communicated these objectives to the OD and to the experiment controllers 

The ground segment was implemented using both the IGS and the Internet networks in order to access NASA mission resources. Two HVoDS (managed by HOSC) keysets were used to contact operations partners. All tools necessary for data reception, monitoring, commanding (the experimental scenario required commanding on a very regular basis), timelines visibility and Shuttle tracking were implemented. The operation team included the SOLCON PIs, and ground infrastructure controllers from both SROC and B-USOC.
