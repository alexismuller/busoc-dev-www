PromISS-4 was a Belgian experiment in the International Space Station (ISS) launched with the Progress 20P on 21rst December 2005. Its main scientific objectives were to study proteins, to obtain in microgravity better crystals, to understand protein crystal growth processes.

Presentation
====================

The PromISS investigation included a holographic microscope that allowed the visualization of the protein crystal growth. Studying the processes by which these crystals grew in microgravity helped scientists to better understand the role of the proteins in disease and to develop new drugs.

Responsibilities
=======================

* support to the scientists during the inflight operations
* upload of telecommands to the payload via HOSC

Involved Centres and Teams
============================

Responsible scientists were Ingrid Zegers (VUB) for the science and Frank Dubois (ULB) for the hardware.
The B-USOC was the European responsible centre for operations in coordination with NASA. This meant that the Centre was responsible for the science follow-on and any routine matter arising from operations. The European Space Agency (ESA) supported the mission. Within this framework, the B.USOC was working together with its partner Space Application Services.
The design of the new experimental cells had been developed by Verhaert Space.
The Telescience Support Center (TSC) formed the direct link between the ground communications network and the ISS. The operations of the Promiss-4 experiment in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) was continuous for 20 days. Astronaut Bill McArthur was the one to work on it.
At the end of the required period, the samples were installed in the return container and brought down back to Earth with the Soyuz 11S.
