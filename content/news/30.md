Danish Astronaut Andreas Mogensen ready to conduct METERON and science operations from the ISS. The launch is scheduled on September 2.

On September 2, Danish ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen will leave on a SOYUZ rocket to the ISS with fellow astronauts Sergei Volkov and Aidyn Aimbetov. During his stay on board the ISS, he will control the EUROBOT robot on ground at ESTEC in the METERON programme, with a new communications protocol adapted for space.

METERON includes collaboration between the ISS space agencies: NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and DLR developing the technology necessary for this objective by commanding a robot on earth by an astronaut on the ISS. ESA, with BELSPO, assigned the support of the ISS operations within the METERON project to B.USOC. The overall coordination of METERON operations is split between the European Satellite Operations Centre of ESA in Darmstadt, Germany and the ESTEC in Noordwijk, Holland.

Andreas Mogensen will operate also several scientific experimeents including THOR: a preparatory programme for ASIM, a future payload of the ISS designed to measure the upper atmospheric light phenomena observed above strong lightings. These phenomena are called sprites and elves. B.USOC is Facility Responsible Centre for ASIM. The ASIM and THOR science teams are led by Danish scientist Torsten Neubert.
