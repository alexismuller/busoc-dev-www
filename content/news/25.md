NASA has developed a new manned spacecraft: ORION which will be the first since APOLLO to travel beyond the earth orbit with the moon, Mars or asteroids as destinations. These exploration targets are the future of manned exploration. The first unmanned test flight will take place in December this year from NASA Kennedy Space Center to recovery at sea in the Pacific Ocean.

Even without a payload we can participate by having NASA write our name on a memory chip which will be carried by ORION

The participants will not only receive their first boarding pass but will earn miles awards which they will be able to increase by participating again in the next flights!
