For specific experiment operations, dedicated User Home Bases (UHB) have been set up when required. UHBs, which are the investigator's location at the "home" institutes, are typically national institutions (e.g. universities, national centers), which need to obtain the adequate communication and data processing infrastructure allowing real-time data monitoring and control (in some cases) of the respective experiment (e.g. for remote operations).



The B.USOC coordinates and supports this setup, and is the focal point for the operations preparation activities for the UHB, more particularly for the definition of experiment operations requirements, the specifications of hardware, software and the connectivity requirements of the UHB to the ISS ground segment.
