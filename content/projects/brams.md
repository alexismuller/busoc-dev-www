BRAMS (Belgian RAdio Meteor Stations) was a radio set receiving stations using forward scattering techniques to study the meteoroids population. The project was coordinated by the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BISA), within the framework of the Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence (STCE). Most stations were run by Belgian radioamateurs or groups of amateur astronomers.  Two dedicated beacons located in Ieper (Western Belgium) and Dourbes (Southern Belgium) acted as transmitters.
The main goals of this project were:

* to collect and standardize the meteor observations of all the stations
* to write codes for automatic detection of undersense/overdense meteor echoes
* to compute meteoroid flux densities for meteor showers and mass indexes for meteor showers and sporadic meteors
* to determine individual meteor trajectories
* to determine orbital parameters of multi-station meteoroids
* to analyze meteor profiles in order to retrieve physical parameters such as ionization, speed and mass of the meteoroids
* to study head echoes and the so-called "epsilon" echoes
* to promote radio-observation of meteors.
