B.USOC's prime customers are Scientific Institutions and Space Agencies with a requirement for advanced manned and non-manned space technologies not exclusively within the field of Microgravity and Space Sciences research.

**Engineering Support**

Our team of engineers can provide support in the following disciplines:

* Ground control Segment Design support, installation and validation
* Radio frequency and microwave
* Cryogenics and vacuum technology
* Real time embedded control systems
* Automation and Mechatronics
* Space mission system engineering


**Knowledge Management**


* Knowledge Management is a key service for BUSOC with a view over all the content and technology deployed in BELSPO and its related operational projects able to give advice to others and communicate new developments
* This service coordinates data storage, dissemination and technical tools and services for B.USOC across all its related projects. It requires an understanding of metadata, content ingestion procedures, web technologies, tools and services and very good communication skills
* This service aims to design a plan that allows for optimal communication within the project and the dissemination of information and knowledge generated by the project to relevant stakeholders


**Product Assurance and Quality Assurance**

Product Assurance (PA) and Quality Assurance (QA) are continuous functions required to ensure the quality of the B.USOC processes and deliverables, and their gradual improvement. The tasks include: the monitoring of the B.USOC configuration management, the support to ESA for the Product Assurance and Safety function related to the ISS Columbus activities, the run of the B.USOC internal anomaly report board, the quality review of any document delivered in the frame of B.USOC activities, the witnessing of maintenance activities by third parties (e.g. Payload Developers), QA support during formal tests, and the improvement of the B.USOC PA Plan when required.


**Sciences and Technological Coordination**

The objectives of this service are:

* To provide the overall scientific direction and to drive the progress of the project, steering efforts of the partners for the achievement of milestones and ensuring that the work is undertaken with appropriate quality levels.
* To provide a unified scientific and technological view and strategy that reinforces the integration of the different resources and tasks towards the unique system that the project aims to develop and validate
* To continuously assess the degree of fulfillment of the project's objectives
* To ensure that the project is not hampered by ethical problems and respects all relevant international and national regulations in this regard


**Mission Operations**

B.USOC is the interface between the science teams and the space operational world. It integrates and prepares the experiment according to the scientific needs and requirements, considering the operational constraints. B.USOC interfaces also closely with the payload developer to prepare the operational products, to troubleshootshoot payload anomalies occuring during flight.

The Mission Operations Service framework addresses end-to-end interaction between applications that reside within both the space and ground segments. The underlying transport services over which Mission Operations services are carried out may be different depending on the nature of the communications path:

* between space and ground
* within the ground segment
* on board the spacecraft itself

This service also includes:

* monitoring and control of the spacecraft subsystems and payloads
* payload performance analysis and reporting
* planning, scheduling and execution of mission operations
* delivery of mission data products
