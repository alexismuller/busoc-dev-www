After the successful OPSCOM-2 test of August 7, ESA released a video showing the complex operations of the EUROBOT in ESTEC commanded by astronaut Alexander Gerst from the ISS using the Disruptive/Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) communication protocol.

METERON is a programme common to the ISS space agencies: NASA, ESA, Roscosmos and DLR developing the technology necessary for this objective by commanding a robot on earth by an astronaut on the ISS. ESA with the support of BELSPO assigned the METERON project to B.USOC.
