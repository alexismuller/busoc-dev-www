The ESA British astronaut Tim Peake landed on June 18 after an extremely successful science mission oriented in large part towards the future manned exploration programme.

He conducted ESA experiments and the METERON Supvis-M test of driving a Martian lander mockup from the ISS in a realistic set-up in the dark.

Much more details can be seen on the mission web site: https://principia.org.uk/the-mission/ and http://blogs.esa.int/tim-peake/
