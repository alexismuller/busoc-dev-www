ASIM (Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor) was arrived on April 13, 2018 on the International Space Station (ISS).  


This instrument can observe TLE (transient luminous events) and TGF ( Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes )  for a better understanding of the influence of violent storms on the atmosphere and the climate on Earth. 


B.USOC is the ESA responsible center for the ASIM infrastructure : 

- receiving the telemetries, monitoring the instrument
- delivering the data to ASIM Science Data Centre in Denmark.
