European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Frank De Winne, of Belgian nationality, flew to the International Space Station (ISS) in late October 2002 on board a Russian Soyuz taxi flight. He became the first Belgian to visit the ISS. During the mission, named OdISSea, De Winne performed a series of science and technology related experiments on board the ISS.

Belgian Federal Science Policy Office provided the funding for De Winne's flight and the related experimental program.



Mission preparation, implementation and operations
====================================================

The support to the Belgian mission was given by ESA.

OdISSea Mission management (located at ESTEC) in direct interaction with the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office was concerned with:

* Top level managerial activities that involved external entities and had a major effect on the relations with other organizations
* Management of programmatic aspects of the project
* Strategic directions with respect to ESA/Russian and ESA/NASA coordination
* Coordination of relationship with the public (press release, etc.)
* Mission insurance (safety quality insurance of the OdISSea mission payload complement)

ESA OdISSea Operations Coordination Team at the Taxi Operations Coordination Centre - TOCC was implemented for the occasion in the Erasmus Centre located at the European Space Research and Technology Center- ESTEC (the Netherlands)

Roles and Responsibilities
========================================

The functions of the B.USOC during operations were the following:

* Implementation of agreed science and mission activities
* Scientific (Life Sciences and Physical Sciences) support to the TOCC
* Scientific (Life Sciences and Physical Sciences) support to the PI's at the B.USOC
* Scientific (Physical Sciences) interface to the TOCC
* Coordination and implementation of public relations
* Communication network maintenance
* Acquisition display and storage of ISS telemetry and orbit parameters
* Acquisition display and storage of audio- video transmissions related to experiments and mission support
* Acquisition and report of ISS mission status
* Display of relevant information related to the mission (timeline, etc.)
* Accommodation of ESA representatives

Collaboration with scientists
=====================================

In general scientists and representatives of Qinetiq Space and CNES had been present for the critical moments of their experiments. For some experiments (PROMISS – DCCO – NEUROCOG – CARDIOCOG) their presence was required all the time of their experiment run.

The interventions made by the scientists, technical representatives and B.USOC operators consisted mainly of:

* Quasi instantaneous responses concerning the manipulations of their experiment
* Interactions with ESA – Safety – MSG – POD etc.... to elaborate changes in procedures
* Development of new or recovery procedures (PROMISS, NEUROCOG, CARDIOCOG)
* Analysis of data and video (PROMISS – DCCO – COSMIC) on the spot with twice the upload of corrected positions for PROMISS and GO / NO GO for COSMIC
* Planning and requests for video requirements
* Discussion with ESA Scientific coordinator (Life and Physical)

Interface with UHB's
=========================


There had been a regular contact with the two Belgian UHB’s during the mission. This allowed to have a back up of data and video and to have more people able to verify the experiments performance. For COSMIC, this allowed to have only one scientist at the B.USOC and to have the others at the UHB. This implied an efficient way of working and decision making after phone contacts with people at the UHB.

Next to the operations room, there was a meeting room that could be used by the scientists and by B.USOC team when their presence was not required in the ops room. In this meeting room, there was one PC with access to OCMS, CEPP timeline and mail.

Education
==========================

Organization of several events in order to promote the odISSea mission : Round table at the Euro Space Center which was live broadcasted on VRT radio and RTBF radio in the presence of the scientists involved in the mission, participation in various exhibitions,...

The B.USOC made a 19 minutes video film on the mission itself as well as on the Belgian scientists involved.

After the mission, an educational video tape was made by the Science Policy Office with contributions from the B.USOC.

Scientific program
===========================

The scientific program during the OdISSea mission was the most important realized during a Soyuz Taxi-flight. The program was realized in the US laboratory Destiny for the experiments performed in the MSG and in Russian segment for the other experiments.

The scientific program had been performed onboard the ISS by Frank De Winne and the Russian cosmonauts. They were also subjects for the life science experiments. The 21 in-flight experiments were implemented by ESA and the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, in compliance with the applicable technical requirements. ESA and Belgian Federal Science Policy Office had also developed and manufactured hardware for the experiments.
