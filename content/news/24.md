Friday September 19, the B.USOC team will participate to a team building activity at Euro space center in Redu (Luxembourg-Belgium) during 2h30.

"EURO SPACE CENTER is a discovery and recreation centre on the theme of space exploration and its impact on our daily lives."

The Euro Space Center propose to B.USOC a VIP Tour with a guided tour of "A Space Odyssey" and at the end the possibility to test two training machines used by astronauts: the moonwalk simulates walking on the Moon and the multi-axis chair recreates the feeling of disorientation felt in space.

The visit ends with a lunch at the "Space resto".
