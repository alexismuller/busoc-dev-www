A FP-7 project to support the European astrobiology network including a mandate to draft a roadmap for astrobiology which was used for the definition of the HORIZON 2020 programme.

The programme began in early 2013 and organized 4 thematic road mapping workshops. It drafted a questionnaire which circulated in the European astrobiology community. ASTROMAP supported also the education aspects of EANA and its outreach parts overlapped very well with the international cooperation and extension objectives of EANA."
