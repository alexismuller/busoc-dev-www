The  Portable Power Supply was an autonomous converter unit to distribute 28VDC to one or more payloads (up to three) taking the upstream power 120VDC provided by ISS Columbus Module SUP.

KuPS was composed of a metal box containing all the required electronic parts and provided of interface connectors, on/off manual switches and autonomous cooling system (forced air convection).  In addition, KuPS provided its own input power cable necessary to connect it to SUP J03 outlet (120VDC).
