B.USOC distributes Pléiades images already bought and exploited by Belgian customers through the BELSPO STEREO programme.



B.USOC distributes Pléiades images already bought and exploited by Belgian customers through the BELSPO STEREO programme. The CNES-European Union Pléiades 1A and Pléiades 1B satellites operate as a constellation in the same orbit, phased 180° apart. The identical twin satellites deliver very-high-resolution optical data products in record time and offer a daily revisit capability to any point on the globe. They provide 50-cm resolution colour imagery for a 20 km footprint at nadir.
