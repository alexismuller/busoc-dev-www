Science is running again on FSL! The Fluid Science Laboratory, onboard Columbus, was failing to downlink High Rate data for quite some time.

But yesterday, a workaround to get scientific videos on the ground was finally put in place and tested successfully with the Geoflow experiment, thanks to the perseverance and dedication of B.USOC engineers, professionalism of Airbus (Bremen) and of the Spanish USOC (E.USOC), and the great support and flexibility of the Columbus Control Centre.

B.USOC is looking forward resuming Geoflow scientific runs in the coming months.
