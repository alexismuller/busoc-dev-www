Picard was a microsatellite sending back data needed to improve models used for forecasting solar activity. It was designed to take simultaneous measurements of parameters such as the speed at which the Sun rotates, the radiation it emits, the presence of sunspots and its shape and diameter, to help scientists understand the relationship between them.  These models also helped to evaluate the influence of the Sun on the dynamic chemical processes governing balances in Earth's atmosphere.

Objectives
===================

The Picard programme also had other objectives, namely to study the Sun's internal structure using helioseismology techniques and to analyse the impact of solar variability on the processes governing balances in Earth's atmosphere, notably the relationship between solar ultraviolet radiation and stratospheric ozone.
CNES was responsible for developing the Picard system, particularly the satellite, which it was also operating. The LATMOS atmospheres, environments and space observations laboratory at CNRS was prime contractor for development of the payload and specifically the SODISM instrument. The two other instruments, PREMOS and SOVAP, had been developed respectively under the responsibility of Swiss Space Office and the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office.
The science operations centre for Picard (CMS-P) was operated by the B.USOC. Its main responsibilities were to program the payload according to the scientific objectives and the operational and technical requirements, to gather and analyse the payload-related housekeeping data, to process and distribute the raw and calibrated data. At the end of the mission, after a period for massively reprocessing the data, the scientific products were transferred to the IAS-MEDOC for long term archiving.


History
=============================

The Sun and its impact on Earth's climate is a topic of prime importance. The PICARD project was first proposed in 1998 by the Aeronomy laboratory of the French national scientific research centre (SA/CNRS). On December 3rd 2004, the CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) Board of Directors decided to authorize this project frozen since April 30 2003, in line with the recommendations of its Science Programme Committee. Il will go live in 2008.

Picard was a CNES Myriade microsatellite that measured the Sun's diameter and its variations, as well as solar irradiance, with the twofold aim of learning more about how the Sun affects Earth's climate and studying its physics and inner structure.

Initially scheduled for 2003, Picard had been launched on June 15th 2010 at the start of the next solar cycle, on a scheduled two-year mission. The microsatellite's payload comprised:

* an imaging telescope (developed by SA/CNRS) capable of measuring the Sunâ€™s shape and diameter to within a few billion seconds
* a suite of three photometers and radiometers (Swiss PREMOS 2 instruments) to study ozone and solar oscillations
* a differential radiometer (Belgian SOVAP instrument) to measure total solar irradiance


B.USOC responsibilities
============================================

The main tasks of the CMS-P were to:

* acquire the data necessary to the CMS-P operations
* program the payload
* control the health status of the payload
* realize the scientific products of the mission (LO to L2A)
* distribute the products


First decentralized CNES scientific Mission Centre
===========================================================

The PICARD microsatellite mission provided 3 years simultaneous measurements of the solar diameter, differential rotation and solar constant to investigate the nature of their relations and variabilities. The PICARD  systems used most of the basic components of the CNES microsatellite product line. Except for the altitude control system, the microsatellite platform for PICARD was very similar to that of DEMETER.
The PICARD Mission Centre was operated by the B-USOC and that antenna (S band) in Toulouse and Kiruna were used for telemetry needs (about 1.5 Gbits per day). Depending on the data compression scheme selected, a higher telemetry rate (1.9 Gbits per day) could require a third antenna. The delivery key point (hand over) of PICARD CMS took place on November 23 and 24, 2010, in Brussels with  representatives from CNES,  which was the prime contractor for this development, from B-USOC which was its operator, from BELSPO, which funded the development and the operations and from BIRA-IASB which hosted it.
After the key point, the CMS-P was accepted without reservation by its operator. The operations responsibility, conducted in coordination with the Mission Operations Preparation Group (scientific group) and its maintenance switched from CNES to B-USOC. These last delivery and responsibility change concluded the passage of PICARD system to routine operation mode.
