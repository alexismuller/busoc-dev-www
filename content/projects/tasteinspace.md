The activity was aiming to demonstrate to primary school students the differences in the way in which the sense of taste is affected under weightless conditions and on Earth by comparing the results of a blind tasting of 6 different food items on the ground and in space.

Video files of the demonstration accounting for almost one hour of material were downlinked to ground. The recording of the demonstration was used to produce ESA educational web based material for upper primary school teachers and their students aged 10-12.
